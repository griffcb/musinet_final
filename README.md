For this project I wanted to create a website that was the interface for a social media platform. This would be a platform for people who wanted to share music with each other using Soundcloud. I used mdbootstrap and created several pages, including a music submission page, a bug/user report page, and a few others. I can't actually make this platform into a social media site without data storage, but if I decide I want to I have the entire layout now.
